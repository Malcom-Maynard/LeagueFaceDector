Hello, this program uses Open CV and Kervas in order to identify faces and scrapes data from OP.GG to display some on their status on the screen. 

   Adding new faces:

		o To add new faces, you have updated the ‘keras_model.h5’ file. I used the site Teachable machine to generate 
		said file and the ‘labels.txt’.
		
		
		
   Adding new accounts:
   
		o	To add a new account, you have to add in the person’s name along with the region 
			of their account and the account name
		o	This is added to the dictionary found in the ‘WebScarper.py’ file under the WebScaraper class
